From the above results, we see that vehicle length and ground clearance contributed essentially zero amounts of random variance. This means they have a large impact on the MPG of the vehicle. 

Because our p-value is far below 0.05%, we can safely reject the null hypothesis, meaning the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

Although we have a good p-value, since only two of our five variables are significant, this could be an example of oversampling
